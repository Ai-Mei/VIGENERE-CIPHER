# VIGENERE-CIPHER


*This program is a Vigenère Cipher program that was written in Python language.*

>This project is created by me because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I created this program is to improve my programming knowledge.

### *Project Description*
>This Vigenère cipher program project works by accepting: 1. message, and, 2. keyword from the user. The inputs of the user may only consist of the 26 alphabets from A-Z. Each letter on the inputted message and keyword will have a corresponding value (0-25). To encrypt the message, the corresponding values of every letter in the message and the corresponding values of every letter in the keyword will be added according to their indexes (if the keyword has a shorter letter count than the message, the keyword will repeat so that every letter in the message will have a corresponding keyword letter to be added with). The resulting value from adding the letter(s) in the message and keyword will be translated back to letters according to their corresponding values (if the resulting value is greater than 25, the count will repeat to A).


### *How to Use?*
>To use this program:
>1. The user will be needing to download the file.
>2. Once downloaded, open the file with any type of Python Integrated Development Environment or IDE and run the program.
>3. Next, once the program is running, the console will give the instructions step-by-step.
>4. Specifically, the program will ask the user to get started.
>5. Then, the program will ask the user for a message and a keyword.
>6. Finally, once the message and keyword are encoded by the user, the program will display the message and keyword that were inputted by the user along with the ciphered message.
